Sentiment Ambiguity Challenges: Sentiment classification in RAFT V3 encounters real-world complexities due to the nuanced nature of free-form language. Text comments often contain ambiguous language, sarcasm, or jargon, which can affect sentiment interpretation. For instance, certain comments tagged as neutral may align with detractor survey scores, such as “because of your ESG policy,” while promoter scores might occasionally include negative remarks. These scenarios highlight the inherent challenges in interpreting sentiment from subjective or complex language, rather than any limitations of the model itself.
