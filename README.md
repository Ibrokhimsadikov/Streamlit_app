**Option 3: RAFT V3 Aspect-Based Model Approach**

**Overview:**
The RAFT V3 aspect-based model combines multiple NLP tasks into a single framework, capturing a detailed view of client feedback. After piloting, users recommended improvements to better classify topics within aspects, refine broad or overlapping experience chunks, and improve extraction methods. The model works by simultaneously extracting aspects and experiences, assigning categories, classifying sentiment, and linking related aspects and experiences, providing a richer layer of insights.

**Key Features and Considerations:**
- **Feedback on Classification and Refinement:** Users noticed that some aspect topics were frequently categorized as "No Topic," where clearer classification would enhance the model's precision. Similarly, certain experience chunks were either too broad or overlapping, making the insights less distinct and actionable.
- **Unified Multi-Task Framework for Nuanced Insights:** This model unifies several tasks—aspect extraction, experience categorization, sentiment classification, and linking aspects to experiences—capturing nuanced insights within feedback data. This multi-task structure gives the model greater potential for revealing connections that can support more informed decisions.
- **Complexity for Users in Interpreting Structured Output:** The layered and relationship-based output requires users to understand the connections between aspects and experiences, which might be challenging without some orientation.
- **Training Data and Sentiment Ambiguity:** Developing RAFT V3 demands substantial labeled data across several components—aspect and experience extraction, categorization, sentiment, and entity linking. Sentiment analysis poses specific challenges due to context interpretation, where language ambiguity, such as sarcasm or jargon, can mislead the model.
   - **Sentiment Misalignment with Survey Scores:** Some sentiment results don’t align with survey scores. For example, comments with neutral sentiment may coincide with a detractor survey score (e.g., "because of your ESG policy") or a promoter score with negative sentiment. This indicates the risk of misclassification, especially in ambiguous contexts.

**Business Value:**
- **Detailed Feedback Analysis with Connections to Sentiment and Experience:** RAFT V3’s structure provides a detailed view by connecting specific aspects with experiences and capturing nuanced sentiment. This makes it well-suited for businesses needing insight into the deeper layers of client feedback.
- **Usefulness for Strategic Decisions:** By offering a granular, multi-dimensional perspective on feedback, this approach supports strategic decision-making, highlighting specific areas for product or service improvements.

**Conclusion for Stakeholders:**
RAFT V3 offers valuable, structured insights connecting aspects, experiences, and sentiment. Its detailed output has high potential but requires significant data resources and user adaptation to interpret. Businesses needing highly detailed insights may find this complexity justified by the depth of information provided, though training support and data preparation should be considered upfront.


Complexity for Users in Interpreting Structured Output: Due to the model’s unique structure, which differs from traditional analysis methods, users need time to understand the relationships between aspects and experiences within the output. This adjustment period may slow adoption initially as users familiarize themselves with interpreting how aspects link with experiences in the structured framework.
