Thank you for the additional context. Here’s a closer alignment with your original wording:

- **Sentiment Ambiguity Challenges:** Sentiment analysis in RAFT V3 is particularly complex, as the model is trained solely on text and relies on assumptions based on the provided context. The ambiguous and free-form nature of client comments introduces factors like sarcasm and jargon, which can impact interpretation. Users reported cases where aspects were tagged as neutral, yet the survey score indicated a detractor sentiment—such as with comments like “because of your ESG policy.” Similarly, there have been instances where a promoter score included aspects with negative context. These examples underscore the challenges of accurately gauging sentiment from nuanced and varied language.
